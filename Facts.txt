A monorail is a railway in which the track consists of a single rail or beam. Colloquially, the term "monorail" is often used to describe any form of elevated rail or people mover.[1] More accurately, the term refers to the style of track.[note 1] Monorail systems are most frequently implemented in large cities, airports, and theme parks.
